# Satellite_images_Buildings-Roads-Tracks-Trees# README for Snipped SpaceNet Dataset  

## Overview

This repository contains the SpaceNet dataset, which is utilized for semantic segmentation tasks involving satellite imagery. The dataset contains multi-band satellite images and ground truth annotations for various land cover classes. The primary objective is to provide researchers and developers with data to train and evaluate models for accurately identifying and counting trees and other land uses.

## Folder Structure

The dataset is organized into two main folders:

```
/data/
├── gt_mband/       # Ground truth (annotations)
│   ├── img1.tif    # Ground truth image for image1
│   ├── img2.tif    # Ground truth image for image2
│   └── ...         # Additional ground truth images
│
├── mband/          # Multi-band images
│   ├── img1.tif    # Multi-band image for image1
│   ├── img2.tif    # Multi-band image for image2
│   └── ...         # Additional multi-band images
```

### Description of Directories

- **gt_mband/**: 
  Contains the ground truth (GT) annotations in the form of multi-band TIFF images. Each file in this folder corresponds to a specific scene and contains binary masks for land cover classes:
  - `Buildings`
  - `Roads & Tracks`
  - `Trees`
  - `Crops`
  - `Water`

- **mband/**:
  Contains satellite images, typically in multi-band format. Each image file corresponds to the same scene as its associated ground truth image in the `gt_mband` folder. The images contain the following bands:
  1. Band 1: (e.g., Blue)
  2. Band 2: (e.g., Green)
  3. Band 3: (e.g., Red)
  4. Band 4: (e.g., NIR)
  5. Band 5: (e.g., SWIR)
  6. Band 6: (e.g., etc.)
  7. Band 7: (e.g., etc.)
  8. Band 8: (e.g., etc.)

## Labels

### Ground Truth Classes

The ground truth annotations identify various land cover classes represented in the images. The classes are as follows:

1. **Original Image with the 8 Bands**: This refers to the original satellite image containing multiple spectral bands.
2. **Ground Truths: Buildings**: Binary masks indicating the presence of buildings in the imagery.
3. **Ground Truths: Roads & Tracks**: Binary masks indicating the presence of roads and tracks in the imagery.
4. **Ground Truths: Trees**: Binary masks indicating the presence of trees.
5. **Ground Truths: Crops**: Binary masks indicating crop areas.
6. **Ground Truths: Water**: Binary masks indicating water bodies.

## Usage

This dataset is intended for both academic and research purposes, especially for developing, training, and testing machine learning models in remote sensing, urban planning, and environmental analysis.

### Example of Loading Data
You can use Python packages such as `tifffile`, `matplotlib`, and `geopandas` to load and visualize the images and their corresponding ground truth labels.
